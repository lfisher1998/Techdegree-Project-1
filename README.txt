Hello! My name is Luke Fisher.

This is a program for Techdegree Project 1: Number Guessing Game!

My goal for this program is to hit the Exceeds mark.

In this program, I am trying to perform these tasks:

1. Display a hello message to the user when starting up the game program
2. Store a random integer from 1-10 that the user will try to guess
3. Ask for the user to continously guess a number at random from 1-10
4. As the user guesses, there will be output to give the user hints on whether the correct number is higher or lower
5. Once the user guesses the number correctly, display how many guesses it took
6. Their least amount of guesses will be considered their "high score"
7. Prompt the user if they would like to play again
8. If they say yes, run the game again using the updated high score as a comparable value
8. The more they play, the more opportunities the user will have to beat and update their high score
9. Catch all errors, such as entering a string instead of a numeric value or entering a number out of the range
10. Tell the user in a meaningful way what they need to do to fix their mistake
11. Shut down the program if the user decides to stop playing
